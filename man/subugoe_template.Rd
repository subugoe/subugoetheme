State- and University Library of Göttingen \href{http://pkgdown.r-lib.org}{pkgdown} template
}
\details{
To use this template for website, list {subugoetheme} in your \code{DESCRIPTION} and add to your \verb{_pkgdown.yml}:\if{html}{\out{<div class="yaml">}}\preformatted{template:
  package: subugoetheme
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

As a result, your website will:
\itemize{
\item Use the \href{https://bootswatch.com/3/cosmo/}{bootswatch \code{cosmo} bootstrap theme}.
\item Set the navbar to \code{type: inverse}.
\item Display in a University of Göttingen \strong{color scheme}.
This is determined by the \code{ugoe_bootswatch.css}, which is compiled from \code{ugoe_colors.less}.
The colors were added and downloaded via https://www.bootstrap-live-customizer.com.
\item Include the SUB wordmark in your website as \code{sub_wordmark.jpg}.
\item Add a custom footer including the wordmar.
}
